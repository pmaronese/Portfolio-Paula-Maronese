Hello, my name is Claudia and I'm going to talk about my favorite movie which is: Forrest Gump.

I love it so much that I can't help but see it again every time I get the chance.
I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks, I admire him very much, and without a doubt, seeing him performing that role, is like being invited to a story... and I mean.. Who doesn't like to hear a good story, right?

It touches people with its sweeping story about a gentle soul insisting to anyone who'll listen that, “Life is like a box of chocolates… You never know what you're gonna get.”

I really do consider him a genius, so I followed his career in other movies; for example, I admired his participation in The Green Mile, I follow him in each one of his films.

If someone asked me, what is the part of Forrest Gump that I liked the most, I think it would put me in a bind, there is no way I can truly answer that, but I guess, I would choose the end: when he says goodbye to his son to get into the bus, and the feather again begins to fly, with the sweetest and most tender music I have ever heard.
